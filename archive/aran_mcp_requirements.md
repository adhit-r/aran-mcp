# Aran-MCP Security Framework Requirements & Implementation Plan (2025)

## 1. Threat Landscape Analysis (2025)

### Key Trends
- **MCP-specific exploits**: Increasing attacks on control-plane protocols, container orchestration, and distributed scheduling layers.
- **LLM-integrated risks**: Prompt injection, data leakage, and adversarial manipulation of onboarding pipelines.
- **Post-Quantum Readiness**: Early adoption of PQ cryptography due to NIST standards finalization (2024-2025).
- **AI-Augmented Attacks**: Automated reconnaissance and exploit chaining via LLM-powered agents.
- **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: Dependency poisoning and misconfigured open-source libraries in MCP ecosystems.

### Implications
Aran-MCP must be **zero-trust aligned**, **policy-driven**, and **self-adaptive**, with **runtime verification** of both control plane and AI-driven extensions.

## 2. Competitive Benchmarking

| Tool      | Strengths | Weaknesses | Takeaways for Aran-MCP |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------------|
| **King MCP** | Strong orchestration & RBAC integration | Limited AI/LLM risk coverage | Add AI-aware policy enforcement |
| **AKTO** | Robust API security testing | Focused narrowly on APIs | Broaden to full MCP ecosystem |
| **OpenMCP** | Open-source, modular | Weak enterprise integrations | Maintain open-source base, add enterprise-ready connectors |
| **CloudMCP** | Cloud-native monitoring | Vendor lock-in | Build cloud-agnostic, hybrid deployment support |

## 3. Requirements Specification

### Functional Requirements

1. **Dynamic Policy as Code**
   - Policies defined in YAML/Rego, enforced in real-time.
   - LLM-assisted onboarding to suggest org-specific templates.

2. **Multi-Layer Security Enforcement**
   - Control-plane hardening: authN/authZ, secure communication.
   - Data-plane validation: encryption, runtime anomaly detection.

3. **LLM-Aware Threat Protection**
   - Prompt injection detection.
   - AI-generated audit logs with anomaly scoring.

4. **Supply Chain Security**
   - SLSA Level 3+ compliance.
   - Dependency scanning & SBOM generation.

5. **Observability & Dashboarding**
   - Org-specific dashboards via LLM-driven customization.
   - Multi-tenant support for distributed environments.

6. **Post-Quantum Cryptography Support**
   - Integration of PQ algorithms for TLS and key exchange.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Must support from 10-node to 10,000-node MCP clusters.
- **Resilience**: Self-healing with minimal downtime (<30s recovery).
- **Openness**: 80%+ features powered by open-source libraries.
- **Interoperability**: Connectors for GitHub, Jira, Kubernetes, and SIEMs.

## 4. Phased Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Core Security Foundation (3-4 months)
- LLM-assisted onboarding (using Hugging Face/BitNet/GPT local)
- Basic dashboards (Grafana/Streamlit)

### Phase 2 – Advanced Protections (4-6 months)
- LLM threat detection (prompt injection filters)
- Supply chain scanning (Syft, Grype)
- Runtime anomaly detection (Falco, eBPF)

### Phase 3 – Enterprise-Grade & PQ Readiness (6-8 months)
- Post-Quantum crypto integration (liboqs, PQC-TLS)
- Multi-tenant, hybrid deployment model
- Advanced observability with AI-driven anomaly scoring

### Phase 4 – Continuous Security Evolution (Ongoing)
- Regular benchmarking vs. AKTO, King MCP, OpenMCP
- Open-source community contributions
- Integration with compliance frameworks (NIST, GDPR, HIPAA)

## 5. Tooling & Testing Strategy

- **Testing**: Chaos engineering (Litmus), penetration tests (Metasploit, custom LLM adversaries).
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions + Trivy/Grype scanning.
- **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
- **Validation**: Compliance with CIS benchmarks for Kubernetes/MCP.

---

## 6. Summary

Aran-MCP is designed to be:
- **Industry-agnostic by default**
- **Customizable via LLM onboarding**
- **Resilient, scalable, and PQ-ready**
- **Competitive with existing solutions while staying open-source centric**
