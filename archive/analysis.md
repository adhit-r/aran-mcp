# Aran-MCP: Comprehensive Security Requirements and Roadmap

## 1. Industry & Deployment Context

Aran-MCP is designed as an industry-agnostic security framework that can be customized for any organization's needs. During onboarding, AI (LLM) capabilities can be leveraged to analyze an organization's industry, data schemas and compliance requirements, and then dynamically configure a contextual dashboard and policies for that domain. The solution should scale from small teams to global enterprises and hybrid-cloud environments, ensuring support for multi-tenant and distributed systems. In practice, this means using open-source libraries (e.g. for encryption, logging, monitoring, LLM inference) and orchestration tools (e.g. Kubernetes, Docker) to keep the system flexible and portable.

## 2. MCP Threat Landscape (2025)

Modern MCP deployments face a broad spectrum of new attack vectors. Security research highlights that prompt injection and tool poisoning are chief risks: malicious or obfuscated prompts can trick an LLM into invoking dangerous tool calls ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com), [thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com)). For example, hidden instructions in an email tool could make an AI forward sensitive messages to an attacker-controlled address ([thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com)). Similarly, "rug pull" and tool description attacks have been demonstrated, where a benign-looking MCP tool later executes malicious actions ([thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com), [redhat.com](https://redhat.com)).

Additional threats include misconfiguration and privilege abuse: MCP servers often run with excessive permissions or outdated policies, creating unauthorized access paths ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [akto.io](https://akto.io)). Researchers warn of "shadow APIs" and unmonitored agent channels that bypass intended controls ([akto.io](https://akto.io)). Supply-chain attacks are also critical: MCP servers are code that can be maliciously updated or forked. For instance, a SQL-injection flaw was discovered in an early MCP server implementation and rapidly propagated via forks, demonstrating a serious supply-chain risk ([workos.com](https://workos.com)).

Other notable issues include token/theft and data leakage (e.g. hardcoded or logged credentials can be exfiltrated through MCP tools ([workos.com](https://workos.com))), and cross-server contamination: one MCP server can unintentionally influence another ("tool shadowing"), causing data exfiltration or privilege escalation across contexts ([thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com)). Attackers may also abuse new MCP features like "sampling" (having the MCP client call the LLM) if users do not explicitly confirm actions ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com)). Finally, traditional security factors remain: lack of auditing and incident response planning means breaches can go undetected ([akto.io](https://akto.io)). In summary, MCP threat research (e.g. Adversa's Top-25 list, Akto's MCP risks, Red Hat and Tenable analyses) stresses prompt injection, misconfiguration, privilege escalation, supply chain compromises, and cross-component attacks as high priorities ([techintelpro.com](https://techintelpro.com), [redhat.com](https://redhat.com)).

## 3. Market Survey: Existing MCP Security Tools

A variety of commercial and open-source tools have emerged to address MCP security, each with different focus areas:

### Commercial Solutions

**Salt Security MCP Server** – Extends API security techniques to MCP. It performs AI-driven context-aware traffic analysis and tracks every tool invocation and data flow, providing enterprise-grade threat detection and tool visibility ([nordicapis.com](https://nordicapis.com)).

**Akto MCP Security Platform** – Provides automated discovery of MCP servers across cloud and on-prem, continuous scanning, and real-time monitoring. It defends against prompt injection, tool poisoning, misconfigurations and sensitive-data leaks in MCP workflows ([akto.io](https://akto.io)). (Akto was among the first vendors to market explicitly for MCP security.)

**Palo Alto Networks (Cortex WAAS)** – Integrates MCP security checks into its cloud AI suite. It validates MCP protocol messages, enforces model integrity, and prevents API-based attacks on LLM integrations ([akto.io](https://akto.io)).

**Pillar Security Platform** – Offers a unified AI security solution covering discovery, analysis and protection of LLMs, RAG workflows and MCP servers. It provides continuous logging, anomaly detection of prompts/tool calls, adaptive runtime guardrails, and red-teaming analysis ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [akto.io](https://akto.io)).

**Teleport (Enterprise)** – Applies its zero-trust identity platform to AI. Teleport enforces strict access controls and comprehensive audit trails for MCP interactions, using RBAC and attribute-based policies so LLMs only access explicitly authorized resources ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [akto.io](https://akto.io)).

**Invariant Labs MCP-Scan** – A specialized tool for MCP pipelines. It does static analysis of MCP server code to detect tool-poisoning, "rug pull", cross-origin injections and prompt exploits. It also runs a proxy to monitor and block dangerous calls at runtime, and uses tool "pinning" (hashing) to prevent rogue updates ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [akto.io](https://akto.io)).

**ScanMCP.com** – A cloud-based MCP scanner (commercial) offering deep protocol scanning for context drift, broken transports, misconfigurations, and real-time synchronization checking. Its AI-driven engine visualizes dataflows and flags outdated or insecure links across integrations ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [akto.io](https://akto.io)).

**Equixly CLI/Service** – Provides static and runtime scanning for MCP. It sanitizes prompts, enforces OAuth scopes to avoid confused-deputy issues, checks for injection/SSRF, and tracks tool versions (supply-chain integrity) in CI pipelines ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [akto.io](https://akto.io)).

### Open Source Solutions

**MCPSafetyScanner** – A GitHub tool that emulates different attacker roles against an MCP server. It allows security teams to audit and log every API and tool call for potential risks, effectively "red teaming" the server by simulating misuse ([nordicapis.com](https://nordicapis.com)).

**CyberMCP** – An MCP-based API security tester. It runs LLM agents to probe back-end APIs, finding auth flaws, injection or DoS weaknesses, and checks security headers. It's designed for fast, automated security testing of MCP flows ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [akto.io](https://akto.io)).

### Other Offerings

Emerging platforms like Pillar, PromptSec (Agentic Security), MCP Guardian (EQTY Labs), Docker MCP Toolkit, Kong AI Gateway, and security firms' checklists (e.g. SlowMist) also target MCP threats in various ways ([nordicapis.com](https://nordicapis.com), [akto.io](https://akto.io)). These tools demonstrate that the market is focusing on discovery, scanning, policy enforcement, and logging – but most do not yet claim features like cross-server isolation or side-channel defense.

## 4. Core Feature & Security Requirements

Building on the above insights, Aran-MCP's architecture must integrate multiple layers of defense. Key features include:

### LLM-Aware Threat Detection Engine
Employ AI-driven analysis tailored to MCP traffic. This module should inspect prompts, tool descriptions and API calls for suspicious patterns (e.g. "ignore previous instructions" or hidden commands). Mitigation strategies will include sanitizing inputs, injecting guardrail prompts, and blocking known exploit patterns ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com), [techintelpro.com](https://techintelpro.com)). For example, detecting prompt injection and tool-poisoning is critical; Akto's and other platforms specifically claim protection against these vectors ([akto.io](https://akto.io)). Attack patterns (e.g. jailbreak attempts or context hijacking) can be quantified into a risk score to drive adaptive policy decisions.

### Behavioral Anomaly & Audit Monitoring
Establish baselines of normal MCP/agent behavior per server or agent. Use statistical and ML models to flag deviations (e.g. unusual volume of tool calls, odd command sequences). Full auditing is essential: as Pillar and Teleport note, record all prompts, tool invocations and context changes for compliance and forensic analysis ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [akto.io](https://akto.io)). Real-time correlation across agents and servers helps spot subtle threat chains. Automated red-teaming (like MCPSafetyScanner) should periodically test the system for gaps.

### Cross-Server Isolation (Sandboxing)
Prevent lateral contamination between MCP servers. Each server's state and memory should be cryptographically isolated (e.g. using container namespaces and memory barriers ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com))). Traffic between servers must pass through secure, monotonic channels. Techniques like container sandboxes (e.g. the "Docker MCP Toolkit" approach ([nordicapis.com](https://nordicapis.com))) and hypervisor-enforced separation can enforce 100% isolation of contexts. This counters "cross-server tool shadowing" attacks noted by Tenable/Researchers ([thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com)). Isolation also means enforcing per-server resource quotas (CPU/memory/network) to prevent one server from starving others.

### Secure Communication
All MCP traffic must be encrypted end-to-end, using industry-standard TLS with perfect forward secrecy. In cloud deployments, clients should cryptographically verify MCP servers ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com)) (e.g. via mutual TLS or signed certificates). Channels should be hardened against DNS rebinding and CSRF: for example, strict origin checks and certificate pinning guard against the DNS-rebind style attack on MCP servers ([varonis.com](https://varonis.com)). Prepare for upcoming threats by supporting quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g. lattice-based KEM/signature libraries) as they become standardized.

### Immutable State Management
To prevent state pollution, all critical server state changes must be versioned and integrity-protected. Adopt append-only logs or Merkle-tree snapshots for state history, and cryptographically sign state transitions. Red Hat advises pinning and signing MCP components to ensure their integrity ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com)); similarly, the framework should pin server/tool versions and alert on unexpected updates. If an update is detected without authorization, the system should roll back to the last known good snapshot.

### Execution & Recursion Control
Analyze MCP call graphs before execution to detect cycles or deep recursion. If a request would trigger nested MCP calls, dynamically estimate resource usage and termination probability. Enforce strict timeouts and execution quotas: for instance, apply cascading timeouts on sub-calls and limit call-stack depth. This prevents resource exhaustion attacks via agent loops or denial-of-service. (Red Hat's best practices similarly recommend timeouts on "sampling" LLM calls ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com)).) Any execution plan that is flagged unsafe should be halted or sandboxed.

### Side-Channel Mitigations
Although not yet widely exploited in MCP systems, we must assume that timing, cache and power side channels could leak sensitive inference or state information. Countermeasures include running critical operations in constant time, injecting random delays into response timing, and using cache-partitioning or flushing to prevent Flush+Reload or Prime+Probe attacks. Even dummy operations or noise injection can obscure actual workloads. This ensures that for example, the response time to an authorized request is indistinguishable from a denied or anomalous request, as a generic side-channel defense strategy.

### Byzantine Fault-Tolerance
In multi-server or federated deployments, assume some nodes could be malicious. Implement consensus and voting for critical operations. For example, use a PBFT-like protocol to verify a tool execution: send the operation to (3f+1) servers and accept the result only if a majority agree. The system should detect and quarantine any server that consistently diverges (as Aran's BFTL design suggests). Maintain a reputation score for each server; low-scoring nodes can be isolated. This guards against coordinated "insider" MCP attacks or stolen credentials on one node.

### Threat Intelligence & Adaptive Learning
Integrate global threat feeds and collaborative learning. Subscribe to MCP-specific vulnerability databases (e.g. OWASP MCP Top 25, Adversa's updates) and automatically incorporate new signatures or detection rules. The platform can use federated learning to aggregate anonymized attack telemetry from different deployments, improving its detection models over time. In practice, the system should periodically fetch threat intelligence and use it to update anomaly detectors or blacklisted tool patterns, thereby staying ahead of emerging MCP exploits.

### Compliance & Reporting
Provide dashboards and reports tailored to compliance (e.g. SOC2, ISO 27001) and incident response. This includes detailed logging of policy enforcement actions and audit trails of MCP interactions. Automated alerts for violations (e.g. unapproved tool use, failed integrity checks) must be generated in real time. The framework should support enterprise features like single sign-on integration, role-based access control for administrators, and scalable alerting/archiving pipelines.

Implementation of these features will rely primarily on open-source components and libraries wherever possible (e.g. cryptographic libraries like libsodium/OpenSSL, ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, monitoring stacks like Prometheus/Grafana, etc.), in line with the requirement to leverage open-source technology.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

A phased rollout is recommended, balancing quick wins with long-term goals:

### Phase 1 – Critical Controls (Weeks 1–4)
Deploy the LLM-Aware Detection Engine and basic logging. Implement core static checks for prompt/tool injection (e.g. OWASP-style rules) and start building the anomaly model using existing logs. Set up per-server isolation (e.g. container sandboxes with strict network namespaces ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com))). Begin token and permission auditing (enforce least-privilege, RBAC).

### Phase 2 – Advanced Protections (Weeks 5–8)
Add Recursion and Resource Protection: integrate a call-graph analyzer to prevent infinite loops, and enforce dynamic resource quotas (CPU, memory, I/O). Deploy Side-Channel Defense measures: convert critical code paths to constant-time, and insert timing noise for key operations. Implement preliminary consensus checks for multi-server calls. Integrate vulnerability scanners (e.g. open-source scanners adapted to MCP schema) into CI pipelines.

### Phase 3 – Future-Proofing (Weeks 9–12)
Roll out the Quantum-Resistant Crypto Module: provision lattice-based KEM/signature primitives (e.g. via Open Quantum Safe libraries). Develop or integrate the Threat Intelligence Platform: connect to global feeds (e.g. Adversa, CERT) and train predictive models for emerging MCP threats. Finalize Byzantine-Fault logic: enable voting/quorum services for high-value operations.

### Phase 4 – Enterprise Hardening (Weeks 13–16)
Build compliance automation (automated evidence collection, configuration checks). Add advanced forensics: immutable logging, tamper-evident audit archives, and state-quarantine capabilities. Perform full-scale red-team exercises using tools like MCPSafetyScanner and CyberMCP. Optimize performance: use hardware crypto acceleration, fine-tune ML inference, and ensure overhead targets (e.g. <5% latency impact) are met.

Throughout all phases, use open-source libraries and frameworks. For example, use OWASP ZAP or Postman/Newman for API fuzzing, RBAC modules from Kubernetes or OPA for policy, Elasticsearch/EFK for centralized logging, and Flask/FastAPI or similar for any custom APIs. Leverage open-source LLMs or transformers (local fine-tuned LLM) to assist with natural-language policy explanations and anomaly interpretation.

## 6. Performance & Security Metrics

To validate effectiveness, Aran-MCP should be tested against known MCP threats (e.g. the Adversa Top 25 vulnerabilities). Targets might include:

- **Detection Rate**: ≥99% of simulated prompt-injection/tool-poisoning attempts should be caught.
- **Isolation Guarantee**: Cryptographic or namespace separation should achieve 100% isolation of memory and data between servers (tests should show no cross-leakage).
- **State Integrity**: No unauthorized state changes in audited runs (zero tolerated state-pollution incidents).
- **Timing Variance**: Side-channel mitigations should keep timing differences for varied inputs under 0.1ms, as measured by statistical analysis.
- **Byzantine Resilience**: The system should operate correctly with up to f malicious nodes out of 3f+1.
- **Performance Overhead**: Latency increase for typical MCP calls should be minimal (e.g. <5% for detection checks, <10% memory overhead for isolation). Hardware acceleration (e.g. AES-NI, GPU for ML) should be used to mitigate costs. These metrics will be verified through continuous testing and benchmarking.

## 7. Unique Differentiators

Compared to existing solutions, Aran-MCP stands out by deeply integrating LLM-specific intelligence with system-level isolation and forward-looking defenses. For example, while tools like Akto or Salt focus on detecting anomalous API usage ([akto.io](https://akto.io), [nordicapis.com](https://nordicapis.com)), Aran-MCP also enforces complete inter-server sandboxing (none of the tools claim full memory/barrier isolation), plus proactive side-channel mitigations. Its design includes explicit chain-of-trust (signing and version pinning of MCP servers ([redhat.com](https://redhat.com))) and consensus mechanisms, which to our knowledge are novel in the MCP space. Finally, Aran-MCP is quantum-ready, employing post-quantum cryptography from the outset, and ties into live threat intelligence streams (a more aggressive approach than the static policy frameworks of many competitors). These factors – AI-driven threat analysis, cross-server hermeticity, and future-proof cryptography – make Aran-MCP uniquely robust for 2025's MCP attack landscape.

## 8. Conclusion

Aran-MCP represents a holistic, next-generation security framework for Model Context Protocol deployments. It combines cutting-edge AI-driven detection with rigorous system security principles (sandboxes, immutable state, cryptography) to address both known MCP risks and anticipated future attacks. By benchmarking against emerging threats (as documented by industry research ([thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com), [techintelpro.com](https://techintelpro.com))) and existing tools ([nordicapis.com](https://nordicapis.com), [akto.io](https://akto.io)), Aran-MCP ensures that no major vulnerability category is overlooked. The outlined phased implementation and reliance on open-source tooling also ensures that the framework can evolve quickly as the MCP ecosystem matures. In sum, Aran-MCP's comprehensive requirements and roadmap provide a clear blueprint for securing AI orchestration at scale.
